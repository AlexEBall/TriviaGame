# TriviaGame
This is a timed classic literature trivia game. You'll have about 15 seconds to answer the questions by clicking on one of the buttons. If you click on an incorrect andswer or fail to answer in the alloted time, you will be shown a .gif of shame and the correct answer. If you answer correctly you will be shown a .gif of encouragement. Both correct and incorrect(plus unanswered) .gif's will be shown for 5 seconds before the next question automatically pops up. There are ten questions, once all ten are finished you will be given stats on how well you did. Try your best to answer them all correctly.'
